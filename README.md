# Barrier Options and Killed Diffusions with Euler Schemes

An applied research project on Barrier option pricing using Euler schemes to compute Monte Carlo simulations of killed diffusions. It is based on the original publication _Weak approximation of killed diï¬€usion using Euler schemes_ (2000) by Emmanuel Gobet, and includes C++ based numerical outputs.
